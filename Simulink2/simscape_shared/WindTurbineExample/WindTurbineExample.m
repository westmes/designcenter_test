%% Supervisory Control Subsystem
%
% This subsystem demonstrates how to model the wind turbine state machine.
% The turbine state machine defines four wind turbine states.
%
% _Park brake mode_: This is the entry mode of the wind turbine operation.
% The wind turbine enters the park brake mode from the pitch brake mode when
% the turbine rotor speed is under the permissible limits for safe operation.
% During this mode, the generator is in the tripped state,  the hydraulic
% park brake is
% engaged, and the wind turbine rotor blades are pitched to the braking
% angle for the aerodynamic braking. The hydraulic brake is the secondary method
% for braking the wind turbine.
%
% _Startup mode_: The wind turbine enters the startup mode from the park
% brake mode when the wind speed is under the permissible limits for
% safe operation. The wind turbine enters this mode from the pitch brake
% mode when the wind speed and the turbine speed are under the permissible
% limits. During this mode, the generator is in the tripped state,
% the hydraulic park brake is released, and the wind turbine rotor blades
% are pitched to the minimum
% angle for achieving the maximum turbine rotor acceleration.
%
% _Generating mode_: The wind turbine enters the generating mode from
% the startup mode when the wind turbine rotor speed goes above the
% turbine cut in speed. During this mode, the generator is connected to
% the transformer, the hydraulic park brake is released, and
% the wind turbine rotor blades are pitched to achieve the
% optimal electric power generation as per the operating conditions.
%
% _Pitch brake mode_: The wind turbine enters pitch brake mode from
% generating mode when the wind speed and turbine rotation speed are
% not under the permissible limits. The wind turbine enters the pitch brake
% mode from the startup mode when the wind speed is not under the
% permissible limits. During this mode, the generator is connected to the
% transformer to consume the
% kinetic energy available in the rotor blade, the hydraulic park brake is
% released, and the wind turbine rotor blades are pitched to the braking
% angle for the aerodynamic braking. The aerodynamic braking is the primary
% method for braking the wind turbine.

% or when the wind turbine is under maintenance operation.
% If they are applied above the parking brake speed, the brake can burn out
% or the nacelle can catch fire due to the excessive frictional heat
% generation.

% The wind turbine has a larger time constant and slower response than a
% traditional doubly-fed induction generator (DFIG) system. To simulate
% wind turbine control, you must run the simulation longer.
%
% The closed-loop DFIG system is faster than wind turbine control systems
% such as pitch control. Therefore, a low fidelity lumped DFIG generator
% system is practical for improving simulation speed and providing
% flexibility. The lumped generator system integrates with the wind
% turbine system to simulate different aspects of the control algorithm.
%
% The lumped generator model tracks the grid voltage and phase angle at
% the point of common coupling (PCC) using the phase locked loops (PLL).
% To improve the simulation speed, fast acting PLL is modelled using
% the grid voltage zero crossing detection. Lumped generator uses the grid
% voltage and phase obtained from the PLL and implements the power flow
% equation with the generator lumped leakage inductance and resistance.
% The lumped generator model takes the real power (P), reactive power (Q),
% and reference generator shaft speed as input.
%
% In the wind turbine system, the lumped generator model gets the power
% reference and approximate speed reference input from the wind turbine
% power control system. Based on the reference input, the generator
% applies the load torque to
% the wind turbine shaft and supply the electrical power to the grid.
