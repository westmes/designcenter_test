%% Model Fault-Tolerant Fuel Control System
%
% This example shows how to combine Stateflow(R) with Simulink(R) to model
% hybrid systems. This type of modeling is particularly useful for systems
% that have numerous possible operational modes based on discrete events.
% Traditional signal flow is handled in Simulink while changes in control
% configuration are implemented in Stateflow. The model described in this
% example represents a fuel control system for a gasoline engine. The
% system is robust in that individual sensor failures are detected and the
% control system is dynamically reconfigured for uninterrupted operation.
%% Analysis and Physics
%
% Physical and empirical relationships form the basis for the throttle and
% intake manifold dynamics of this model. The air-fuel ratio is computed by
% dividing the air mass flow rate pumped from the intake manifold by the
% fuel mass flow rate injected at the valves. The stoichiometric mixture
% ratio provides a good compromise between power, fuel economy, and
% emissions. The target air-fuel ratio for this system is |14.6|.
% Typically, a sensor determines the amount of residual oxygen present in
% the exhaust gas (EGO). This gives a good indication of the mixture ratio
% and provides a feedback measurement for closed-loop control. If the
% sensor indicates a high oxygen level, the control law increases the fuel
% rate. When the sensor detects a fuel-rich mixture, the controller
% decreases the fuel rate.
%% Modeling
%
% Open the model. To run the simulation, in the Simulink Toolstrip, on the
% *Simulation* tab, click *Run*.
% 
% The model uses a callback function to load the data required for the
% simulation into the model workspace from |sldemo_fuelsys_data.m|. Loading
% initial conditions into the model workspace keeps simulation data
% isolated from data in other models that you may have open and helps avoid
% MATLAB workspace cluttering. To view the contents of the model workspace,
% in the Simulink Editor, on the *Modeling* tab, in the *Design* section,
% expand the gallery and select |Model Explorer|. In the Model Explorer
% window, in the *Model Hierarchy* list on the left, expand
% |sldemo_fuelsys| and select |Model Workspace|. For more information about
% how to use callbacks to load simulation data, see
% <docid:simulink_ug#mw_eccab73d-8781-4403-9be3-6da56be7df3f>.
% 
% The model logs relevant data to  MATLAB workspace in a data structure
% called |sldemo_fuelsys_output| and streams the data to the Simulation
% Data Inspector. Logged signals are marked with a blue badge. To learn
% more about data logging, see <docid:simulink_ug#bsxca4i-1>.
%
% Note that units are visible on the model and subsystem icons and signal
% lines. Units are specified on the ports and on the bus object.
%
set_param(0,'ExportBackgroundColorMode','white');
open_system('sldemo_fuelsys');
%%
% The Dashboard subsystem allows you to interact with the model during
% simulation. The Fault Injection switches can be moved from the Normal to
% Fail position to simulate sensor failures, while the Engine Speed
% selector switch can be toggled to change the engine speed.The fuel and
% air/fuel ratio signals are visualized using gauges and scopes. The blocks
% in the Dashboard subsystem are from the Dashboard library. To learn
% about dashboard blocks, see <docid:simulink_doccenter#bu4yarb>.
%
open_system('sldemo_fuelsys/Dashboard');
%%
% The fuel_rate_control uses signals from the system's sensors to determine
% the fuel rate which gives a stoichiometric mixture. The fuel rate
% combines with the actual air flow in the engine gas dynamics model to
% determine the resulting mixture ratio as sensed at the exhaust.
%
% You can simulate the failure of each of the four sensors (throttle angle,
% speed, EGO and manifold absolute pressure [MAP]) by switching off the
% corresponding slider switch in the dashboard subsystem. To access the
% switches, double-click the subsystem block named Dashboard. To flip a
% switch, click where you want the handle of the switch to move. If you
% stop the simulation, select the Slider Switch block, then click where you
% want the handle to move. Each slider switch connects to the value
% parameter of a Constant block. When you switch off the slider switch, you
% change the value of the Constant block.
% 
% Similarly, you can induce the failure condition of a high engine speed by
% toggling the engine speed switch on the dashboard subsystem. A Repeating
% Table block provides the throttle angle input and periodically repeats
% the sequence of data specified in the mask.
%
% The fuel_rate_control subsystem uses the sensor input and feedback
% signals to adjust the fuel rate to give a stoichiometric ratio. The model
% uses three subsystems to implement this strategy: one for control logic,
% one for airflow calculation, and one for fuel calculation. Under normal
% operation, the model estimates the airflow rate and multiplies the
% estimate by the reciprocal of the desired ratio to give the fuel rate.
% Feedback from the oxygen sensor provides a closed-loop adjustment of the
% rate estimation in order to maintain the ideal mixture ratio.
%
open_system('sldemo_fuelsys/fuel_rate_control');
%% Control Logic
%
% A single Stateflow chart, consisting of a set of six parallel states,
% implements the control logic in its entirety. The four parallel states
% shown at the top of the chart correspond to the four individual sensors.
% The remaining two parallel states at the bottom consider the status of
% the four sensors simultaneously and determine the overall system
% operating mode. The model synchronously calls the entire Stateflow
% diagram at a regular sample time interval of 0.01 sec. This permits the
% conditions for transitions to the correct mode to be tested on a timely
% basis.
%
% If you enable animation in the Stateflow debugger, the state transitions
% are highlighted in the Stateflow diagram as the various
% states are activated. The sequence of activation is indicated by changing
% colors. This closely coupled synergy between Stateflow and Simulink
% fosters the modeling and development of complete control systems.
%
% To
% <matlab:if(isempty(find_system('sldemo_fuelsys','flat')));load_system('sldemo_fuelsys');end;open_system(['sldemo_fuelsys/fuel_rate_control/control_logic'])
% open> the control_logic Stateflow chart, double-click on it in the
% fuel_rate_control subsystem.
%
open_system('sldemo_fuelsys/fuel_rate_control/control_logic'); 
%%
% When execution begins, all of the states start in their |normal| mode
% with the exception of the oxygen sensor (EGO). The |O2_warmup| state is
% entered initially until the warmup period is complete. The system detects
% throttle and pressure sensor failures when their measured values fall
% outside their nominal ranges. A manifold vacuum in the absence of a speed
% signal indicates a speed sensor failure. The oxygen sensor also has a
% nominal range for failure conditions but, because zero is both the
% minimum signal level and the bottom of the range, failure can be detected
% only when it exceeds the upper limit.
%
% Regardless of which sensor fails, the model always generates the directed
% event broadcast |Fail.INC|. In this way the triggering of the universal
% sensor failure logic is independent of the sensor. The model also uses a
% corresponding sensor recovery event, |Fail.DEC|. The |Fail| state keeps
% track of the number of failed sensors. The counter increments on each
% |Fail.INC| event and decrements on each Fail.DEC event. The model uses a
% superstate, |Multi|, to group all cases where more than one sensor has
% failed.
%
% The bottom parallel state represents the fueling mode of the engine. If a
% single sensor fails, operation continues but the air/fuel mixture is
% richer to allow smoother running at the cost of higher emissions. If more
% than one sensor has failed, the engine shuts down as a safety measure,
% since the air/fuel ratio cannot be controlled reliably.
%
% During the oxygen sensor warm-up, the model maintains the mixture at
% normal levels. You can change the design by moving the warm-up state to
% within the |Rich_Mixture| superstate. If a sensor failure occurs during
% the warm-up period, the |Single_Failure| state is entered after the
% warm-up time elapses. Otherwise, the |Normal| state is activated at this
% time.
%
% A protective overspeed feature has been added to the model by creating a
% new state in the |Fuel_Disabled| superstate. Through the use of history
% junctions, the model ensures that the chart returns to the appropriate
% state when the model exits the overspeed state. With this approach, you
% could add additional shutdown states to the |Fuel_Disabled| superstate if
% additional safety requirements for the engine were to be specified.
%% Sensor Correction
%
% When a sensor fails, the model computes an estimate of the sensor. For
% example,
% <matlab:if(isempty(find_system('sldemo_fuelsys','flat')));load_system('sldemo_fuelsys');end;Handle.rt=sfroot;Handle.m=Handle.rt.find('-isa','Simulink.BlockDiagram');Handle.p=Handle.m.find('-isa','Stateflow.State','-and','Name','Pressure');Handle.p.view;
% open> the pressure sensor calculation.  Under normal sensor operation,
% the model uses the value of the pressure sensor. Otherwise, the model
% estimates the value.

Handle.rt=sfroot;Handle.m=Handle.rt.find('-isa','Simulink.BlockDiagram');...
    Handle.p=Handle.m.find('-isa','Stateflow.State','-and','Name','Pressure');...
    Handle.p.view;
isempty(find_system('sldemo_fuelsys','flat'));
%%
% The model computes an estimate of manifold pressure as a function of the
% engine speed and throttle position.  To compute the value, the model uses
% a Simulink function in Stateflow.

%% Airflow Calculation
%
% The subsystem named |airflow_calc| is the location for the
% central control laws. This block is found inside the fuel_rate_control
% subsystem
% (<matlab:if(isempty(find_system('sldemo_fuelsys','flat')));load_system('sldemo_fuelsys');end;open_system(['sldemo_fuelsys/fuel_rate_control/airflow_calc'])
% open this block>). The subsystem estimates the intake air flow to determine
% the fuel rate which gives the appropriate air/fuel ratio. Closed-loop
% control adjusts the estimation according to the residual oxygen feedback
% in order to maintain the mixture ratio precisely. Even when a sensor
% failure mandates open-loop operation, the most recent closed-loop
% adjustment is retained to best meet the control objectives.
%
open_system('sldemo_fuelsys/fuel_rate_control/airflow_calc');
%%
%
% *Equation 1*
%
% The engine's intake air flow can be formulated as the product of the
% engine speed, the manifold pressure and a time-varying scale factor.
%
% $$q=\frac{N}{4\pi}V_{cd}\nu \frac{P_m}{RT} = C_{pump}(N,P_m) N P_m =
% \mbox{ intake mass flow}$$
%
% $$N = \mbox{ engine angular speed (Rad/sec)}$$
%
% $$V_{cd} = \mbox{ engine cylinder displacement volume}$$
%
% $$\nu = \mbox{ volumetric efficiency}$$
%
% $$P_m = \mbox{ manifold pressure}$$
%
% $$R, T =\mbox{ specific gas constant, gas temperature}$$
%%
%
% |Cpump| is computed by a lookup table and multiplied by the speed and
% pressure to form the initial flow estimate. During transients, the
% throttle rate, with the derivative approximated by a high-pass filter,
% corrects the air flow for filling dynamics. The control algorithm
% provides additional correction according to Equation 2.
%%
%
% *Equation 2*
%
% $$e_0 = 0.5 \mbox{ for } EGO\le 0.5$$
%
% $$e_0 = -0.5 \mbox{ for } EGO > 0.5$$
%
% $$e_1 = K_i (N,P_m) e_0 \mbox{ for } EGO\le 0.5$$
%
% $$\dot{e_2} = e_1 \mbox{ for LOW mode with valid EGO signal} $$
%
% $$\dot{e_2} = 0 \mbox{ for RICH, DISABLE or EGO warmup} $$
%
% $$ e_0, e_1, e_2 = \mbox{ intermediate error signals}$$
%%
% The nonlinear oxygen sensor is modeled using the MATLAB(R) Function block
% named |EGO Sensor|. To view the block, from the top level of the model,
% enter the subsystem named |Engine Gas Dynamics|. Then, enter the
% subsystem named |Mixing & Combustion|.

open_system('sldemo_fuelsys/Engine Gas Dynamics');

%% 
% The EGO Sensor is modeled as a hyperbolic tangent
% function, and it provides a meaningful signal when in the vicinity of 0.5
% volt. The raw error in the feedback loop is thus detected with a
% switching threshold, as indicated in Equation 2. If the air-fuel ratio is
% low (the mixture is lean), the original air estimate is too small and
% needs to be increased. Conversely, when the oxygen sensor output is high,
% the air estimate is too large and needs to be decreased. Integral control
% is utilized so that the correction term achieves a level that brings
% about zero steady-state error in the mixture ratio.
%
% The normal closed-loop operation mode, LOW, adjusts the integrator
% dynamically to minimize the error. The integration is performed in
% discrete time, with updates every 10 milliseconds. When operating
% open-loop however, in the RICH or O2 failure modes, the feedback error is
% ignored and the integrator is held. This gives the best correction based
% on the most recent valid feedback.

open_system('sldemo_fuelsys/Engine Gas Dynamics/Mixing & Combustion');
%% Fuel Calculation
%
% The subsystem named |fuel_rate_control| contains a subystem named
% |fuel_calc|. The |fuel_calc| subsystem sets the injector signal to match
% the given airflow calculation and fault status. The first input to the
% subsystem is the computed airflow estimation. This is multiplied with the
% target fuel/air ratio to get the commanded fuel rate. Normally the target
% is stoichiometric, i.e. equals the optimal air to fuel ratio of 14.6.
% When a sensor fault occurs, the Stateflow control logic sets the mode
% input to a value of 2 or 3 (RICH or DISABLED) so that the mixture is
% either slightly rich of stoichiometric or is shut down completely.
%
open_system('sldemo_fuelsys/fuel_rate_control/fuel_calc');
%%
% The subsystem named |fuel_calc| employs adjustable compensation
% in order to achieve different purposes in different modes. In
% normal operation, phase lead compensation of the feedback correction
% signal adds to the closed-loop stability margin. In RICH mode and during
% EGO sensor failure (open loop), however, the composite fuel signal is
% low-pass filtered to attenuate noise introduced in the estimation
% process. The end result is a signal representing the fuel flow rate
% which, in an actual system, would be translated to injector pulse times.

%% Results and Conclusions
%
% The simulation is run with a throttle input that ramps from 10 to 20
% degrees over a period of two seconds, then goes back to 10 degrees over
% the next two seconds. This cycle repeats continuously while the engine is
% held at a constant speed so that the user can experiment with different
% fault conditions and failure modes.
%
% Click on a sensor fault switch in the
% dashboard subsystem to simulate the failure of the associated sensor.
% Repeat this operation to slide the switch back for normal operation.
%
% Now run the simulation with different sensors turned off. Plot the fuel flow rate and air fuel ratio for
% these scenarios:
% 
% * All sensors function properly
% * Throttle sensor failed
% * Speed sensor failed
% * EGO sensor failed
% * MAP sensor failed
% 
% Examine the fuel flow rate plots. In
% the baseline case, the fuel rate is regulated tightly, exhibiting a small
% ripple due to the switching nature of the EGO sensor's input circuitry.
% In the other four cases the system operates open loop. The control
% strategy is proven effective in maintaining the correct fuel profile in
% the single-failure mode. In each of the fault conditions, the fuel rate
% is essentially 125% of the baseline flow, fulfilling the design objective
% of 80% rich.
